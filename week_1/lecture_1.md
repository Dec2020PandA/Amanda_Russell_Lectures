            - P0: must haves, basic required functionality and functionality-required features
            - P1: neccesary features (beyond fundamentals) to showcase the purpose of the website
            - P2: nicer features you may not get to right away but are needed for overall product down the road
            - P3+: plans for the future of the project, fleshing it out to be "portfolio worthy"
        * SELF SUFFICIENCY - LEARN SOMETHING NEW!!!!
            - Must be a P0 or P1
            *****

            - Remember that you're likely doing things we don't know either, here to help as we can but we're not doing the project for you!

            *****
        * Where to Start
            - Build a project geared toward where you'd like to work/part of the industry that interests you
            - Build a project geared toward community/environmentalism/social_connection/etc
            - Build a project that just interests you, the website you wish existed
            - Piggy back off the project ideas in the Learn Platform
        * Proposal Submission
            - Solo Proposal ideally by Wednesday, no later than Friday
            - balsamiq, pencil, powerpoint -> anything that let's me see a wireframe layout similar to your previous assignments/exams
            - Paragraph summary of the project idea/general goals
            - bullet points for P0, P1, etc.
            - upload to platform as well as in your repo on the github organization alongside your project 


    - Github Overview
        * Separate out the folder you'll be working with
            - preferred to not be buried within your coding dojo assignments (easier/faster access for readers)
            - avoid "repo in a repo", don't initialize a repo within an already existing repo
        * Follow instructions on Github
            - did you receive the github organization invite? Make an account if you don't have one, or let me know if it's under a different email address
            - do NOT make readme or gitignore through github (you have to pull/merge otherwise)
        * begin the project within your repo folder
            - follow instructions on github repo page
            - note "master" vs "main"
            - add a .gitignore file!!!
                * What goes in it?
                    - Check deployment documentation in Learn Platform is a solid start
                    - Check if your special features have additional pieces that should be ignored
        * push to remote repo!
